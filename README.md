# Project Tracker App :sparkles: :white_check_mark: :yarn:

## This is the readme for the aesthetic project tracker app. I made this to keep track of all of the cool projects I would like to work on.

Some features of this app are:

- :green_circle: Thumbnails to easily visually discern what each project is from a glance
- :green_circle: Links to project details or websites with more information if needed
- :orange_circle: Categories to be able to understand what type of a project each one is
- :orange_circle: Progress field to keep track of how the project is going
- :orange_circle: Hotlist to highlight the most interesting projects

More features for this app is sure to follow. Keep coming back to this repo for more details!

## How to set up

To set up to the database (we recommend using MongoDB), add the following variable to your `.env` file:

`MONGO_URI={ YOURDATABASEURI }`
